# The Anatomy of a CSS Selector

CSS selectors are patterns used to select the elements you want to style. Understanding these selectors is crucial for applying styles effectively. Here's an overview of the anatomy of a CSS selector.

## 1. Basic syntax

```markdown
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

* **Selector:** The HTML element you want to style. It could be an element type, a class, an ID, or a combination.
* **Property:** The specific characteristic of the element that you want to style, such as color, font-size, margin, etc.
* **Value:** The value assigned to the property, which defines the appearance of the element.

***Example***

```markdown
p {
  color: blue;
}
```

> Tip: Using more specific selectors can help you target exactly the elements you want without affecting others.

## 2. Types of Selectors

There are several types of CSS selectors, each with its specific use cases.

***Example***

```markdown
.classname {
  font-size: 16px;
}

#idname {
  margin: 10px;
}

element {
  padding: 5px;
}
```

* **Class selector:** Targets elements with a specific class.
* **ID selector:** Targets an element with a specific ID.
* **Element selector:** Targets all elements of a specific type.
